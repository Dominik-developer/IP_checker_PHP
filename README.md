This project was created during building other and I thought I may dive deeper into topic and build it as separate project. 
This program is build to be used in bigger brojects, thats why fronend is very basics.

For fronend I used <a href="https://github.com/Dominik-developer/BaseFrame_CSS_library"> BaseFrame </a> CSS Library and the rest of components is based on fronend of my other form project: <a href="https://github.com/Dominik-developer/search_page_frontend"> Search page </a>.
